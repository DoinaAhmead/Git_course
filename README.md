# we will talk about python code and github commands

# step1:crate your workpace and python the source  code

set up your workpace in the home directory of yuor host:

```` python
def fun1():
	print(" I am function # 1")
	
x = fun1

x()
````
iterable objects can be converted into lists by using the functicon list()
```python
 list(range(1, 3))
[1, 2]
list('ABCD')
['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
 list((1, 2, 3))
[1, 2, 3]
````
is the for loop printing each number in the array
```python
 for loop
for i in [1, 2, 3, 4]:
    print(i, end=", ") # prints: 1, 2, 3, 4,
```
# step1:crate your workpace and Git the source  code
set up your workpace in the home directory of yuor host:
```bash
mkdir p-/ Git_Course
cd -/ Git_Course
```
